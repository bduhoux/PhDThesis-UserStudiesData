The system is changing dynamically with the environment changes (the location, the system hardware, ...).","A context is the environment in which the system is. It is generally something external to the system that influences it and forces it to adapt in order to keep some coherence. For example, a GPS will choose the map depending on the continent where the user is located.","A feature is a functionality that can be part of the system or not, depending on the requirements. For example a car can have a GPS integrated or not.","Context-oriented programming is about making software that can adapt to it's environment, like a phone app that displays in portrait or landscape mode. Feature-based context-oriented programming is developing features that are linked to a context therefore the context limits the features. For example a budget car can only have one USB slot."
