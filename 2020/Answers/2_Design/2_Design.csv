Can you express, on a Likert scale, how difficult you felt it was to design such a system?","Although we did not propose you to use a particular methodology yet to design such a system (we will present you such a methodology later), maybe during this first experience in modelling your assigned case study, you did use some kind of structured approach or series of steps to come up with a relevant set of contexts and features of your system, as well as the mapping between them. With this question we would like to understand what kind of ad-hoc methodology you came up with. What steps did you follow to discover and define relevant features and contexts and the mapping between the two? In what order did you do this? Try to explain your approach in your own words, or just answer this question by writing ""We did not follow a specific approach."" otherwise."

In a lot of our thinking, we first thoughts of different contexts and what features we would like to have in this situation. For example, I could be in a meeting/driving/walking towards my friend's house. What do I want my app to do then? During that step, we took notes on the different contexts and the different features related to them. (Our notes were organized context by context.) 2) We design the context model diagram. (Easy because our notes were organized that way) 3) We designed the feature model diagram. (Not as straight-forward because related features were sometimes at different places in our notes.) 4) We draw the mapping between the contexts and the features. This also helped us better understand what contexts and features would make more sense we continued to modify the context diagram and feature diagram a little bit. 5) We wrote the lexicon, containing all the non obvious terms of our context-oriented feature model, the explainations for the mapping relationships and the priority levels for the texts. Those are all informations that were already rather clear for us and we just had to write it down. Note: We kept on making some minor changes throughout the whole process as new idea and comprehension arised. "

As we weren't sure, we created other features, not especially linked with existing context.
