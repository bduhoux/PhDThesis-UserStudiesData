- The decomposition of responsibility by feature makes it easier to create an application.","- The proposed paradigm is a lot different from traditional MVC programming. Therefore, the learning curve is quite steep. It seems to be easier to do easy things, whereas it becomes a lot harder to properly design a more complex system.
- We cannot create subfolders to structure similar features. This is frustrating when wanting to build larger-scale applications.","We have a feeling that the proposed paradigm has a lot of power. It feels however very disruptive from traditional concepts programmers may have used in the past. For this reason, it may be complex for some programmers to jump into that new paradigm without friction. To avoid this situation, it would be interesting to build a website containing many examples of good practices and design patterns using that language (in the same spirit as https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)."

We are very limited in what we can do and the ""context system"" has too much control over the program.

I feel like only one key (list of activated contexts) will be selected. If it is the case then it would be better to allow the selection of many keys.

- The use of a strong OO language with a lot of standard libraries and documentation.","- One big problem with such a new language like this one is that it suffers from a lot of bugs due to memory leaks which lead to the crash of the whole application. Since the main goal of this application is the ability to switch from one context to another, it is really annoying to face this kind of problem while executing a working implementation. But at the end, we succeeded to make it work!
- Another main problem is the lack of available features. For example: the possibility to add events to window panel, the positioning of an element on the window, the ability to change the attributes of the widgets (e.g.: color, font), ... We had to adapt the code in order to make it works. Hopefully, most of the times, the changes were minimal.
- The lack of documentation. For the given language as well as for the FXRuby framework and the Fox framework (on which FXRuby relies). That leads to a huge waste of time in research and analysing of theses three frameworks.
- A small last problem was the files division of the code application which didn't help to make the code clean and also lost us a lot at the beginning.","- Add more properties to the ui_component
- Reproduce the same structure and hierarchy as the FXRuby for the ui_component (Frame < Window)
- Add comments to explains some methods in the FXUIManager or FXUIFactory
- Fix the memory leaks bug ;)"

We can define all the mappings that we want.
The tool used to simulate the contexts at run time is understandable and easy to use.","We have to create/modify a lot of files to define the features and their adaptation to the context. This induces a big overhead when we want to make small modifications to the code.
The flow of messages by using proceed, and the prologues and epilogues, is a good idea, but it is difficult to understand for a person that learns the language. In general, the learning curve of the language is steep.","It seems that the features are applied in the reverse order as the order in which they are appended to the root context, in the context_declaration file. This is counter-intuitive, and induced some problems, when an element depended on another one that should have been created earlier, but was in fact created later due to this order.

When we make a syntax error when using the context simulator, for example a typo in a context name, the context simulator tool crashes. It should be able to recover from the error, by catching the exception and continue to work."
